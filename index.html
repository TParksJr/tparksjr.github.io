            My name is Tyson Parkin and I am young professional who is currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through the University
            of Toronto’s School of Continuing Studies. My Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy from York University fostered the
            critical thinking skills that allow me to learn quickly, and apply my knowledge effectively in this fast-paced
            industry.

            It was my successful career in IT Sales that first sparked my interest in coding. My resume includes positions at many well-known
            and respected companies within the industry such as Softchoice, CDW and Rogers. Combined with my background in
            visual arts from Etobicoke School of the Arts, I am perfectly suited for a career which requires both creativity
            and an understanding of technology. If you wish to visit my LinkedIn page for more details regarding my education
            and work experience cick on my profile picture.

            I live with my partner and cat (pictured). If you are a recruiter please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
